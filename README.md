# PygamePrompts

This repository contains prompts used for the **ScaDS.AI General Assembly 2025** 2-hour workshop **"Coding Effectively with AI: Getting Started with Cursor and Copilot"**.

## Workshop Overview

**Target Group:** Beginner to intermediate (no coding experience needed)

**Content:** Build a simple Snake game entirely by prompting with Cursor or GitHub Copilot

**Learning Objectives:** Explore different prompting techniques for effective code generation


## Workshop Materials
- [Cursor Download](https://cursor.com/home)
- [Community Pad](https://pad.riseup.net/p/TrS8zBZO1I1feDRa_8ss)

- Slides: TODO

## Linux Cursor Installation 
Please copy the commands one-by-one to your terminal and press Enter. You might need to change the path/file names.

1. Navigate to directory of download file, e.g.: 
```bash
cd Downloads/
```

2. Make file executable:
```bash
 chmod +x Cursor-1.5.9-x86_64.AppImage
```

3. To make Cursor accessible system-wide, move the file to a directory in your PATH, e.g.
```bash
sudo mv Cursor-1.5.9-x86_64.AppImage /opt/cursor/cursor.appimage
```

4. To set up a cursor icon, download the logo for fee from [here](https://lobehub.com/de/icons/cursor) and then move it to the same directory:
 ```bash
sudo mv cursor.png /opt/cursor/
``` 

5. Create a global desktop shortcut (alternative for local shortcut: nano ~/.local/share/applications/cursor.desktop):
```bash
sudo nano usr/share/applications/cursor.desktop
```

6. Add file content & specify icon file path, e.g.:
```bash             
[Desktop Entry]
Name=cursor
Exec=/opt/cursor/cursor.appimage
Icon=/opt/cursor/cursor.png
Type=Application
Categories=Development;
```

In case Cursor doesn't launch try:
```bash             
[Desktop Entry]
Name=cursor
Exec=/opt/cursor/cursor.appimage --no-sandbox
Icon=/opt/cursor/cursor.png
Type=Application
Categories=Development;
```
